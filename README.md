## Overview
This open-source project aims to create a web-based platform for detecting plant diseases using cutting-edge machine learning techniques. The site leverages Vision Transformers (ViTs) for accurate disease identification and provides an intuitive user interface built with ReactJs and NextJs. Additionally, we integrate the Hugging Face API for easy access to pre-trained ViT models. Let‚Äôs dive into the details:

## Features
 1. **Vision Transformer Model (PlantXViT):**
     - We‚Äôve trained our own Vision Transformer model specifically for plant disease identification. This model combines the capabilities of traditional convolutional neural networks with the Vision Transformers to efficiently identify a large number of plant diseases for several crops.
     - Out Model has demonstrated superior performance compared to existing methods on publicly available datasets, achieving high accuracy even under challenging background conditions.
2. **Web Interface:**
    - The site provides an easy-to-use web interface built with ReactJs and NextJs. Users can upload images of plant leaves or other relevant parts to diagnose diseases.
    -  The interface allows users to visualize the prediction results, including the detected disease class and confidence score.
3. **Hugging Face API Integration:**
    - We utilize the Hugging Face API to access the pre-trained ViT model that we created.
    - The Hugging Face Transformers library simplifies model loading and inference, making it convenient for developers.
